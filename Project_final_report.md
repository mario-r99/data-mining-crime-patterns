## Abstract

## Introduction

In every society, criminal behavior has hindered the normal operation of that society. Webster defines *crime* as 'an illegal act for which someone can be punished by the government'[1]. When a crime is committed, all of society suffers, and the individual cost can vary wildly with the type of crime committed. An 2010 analysis of the various costs of crime by McCollister, French, and Fang[2] estimates the cost of a single murder, incuding tangible and non-tangible costs, at around 9 million dollars. In the City of Chicago, there were 494 murders in 2023 (as of October 14)[3]. This would put the total cost for citizens of Chicago at around $4.4 billion dollars.  Similarly, the cost of a rape/sexual assault this year is around three million dollars.

While the costs due to crime can be very large, often police budgets are reduced in times of austerity. The has been reported in various news articles[X] with the ... It is also known that crime affects a city unevenly, with incidents of crime being more likely in particular areas of a city over other parts. It makes sense that police presence should reflect the distribution of crimes in the city. 

In Machine Learning, the technique of clustering divides points of data into different clusters or categories. Additional points of data can then be classified as being part of one of those categories. However, We believe there is more that we can visualize in regards to the clustering of crimes. To this end, we have developed a Python-based web application to examine and analyze the distribution of crime in the city of Chicago. The application uses multiple forms of clustering algorithms to examine the distribution of different type of crime and to provide clusters in order to examine the distribution of crimes in relation to police stations.

## Prior Work

## Chicago Crime Dataset

To plot this data, we are utilizing the Chicago Crime Dataset[3]. This dataset, provided by the city of Chicago, is a record of all reported crimes committed in the city from the year 2001 until the present day.  

## Clustering Algorithms

For this application, we have implemented three separate clustering algorithsm: **KMeans Clustering**, **DBSCAN**, and **Spectral Clustering**.

## Analysis

Write something here about how the distributions are different based on the clustering technique used.

## Conclusions and Future Work
